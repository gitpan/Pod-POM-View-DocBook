Pod::POM::View::DocBook provides a DocBook XML view of a Pod Object Model.

Pod::POM, Text::Wrap and List::MoreUtils are prerequisites.

For testing you will also need:

  Test::More
  Test::Differences
  XML::LibXML
  Class::Accessor

The code is not yet complete - mapping of basic Pod formatting commands is done, but I haven't
looked at the link stuff yet.

Comments and suggestions welcome.
